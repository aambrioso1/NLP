(1).  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
(2).  The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
(3).  In love?
(4).  Of love?
(5).  Out of her favour where I am in love.
(6).  Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
(7).  Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
(8).  Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
(9).  Why then, O brawling love!
(10).  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
(11).  Why, such is love's transgression.
(12).  This love that thou hast shown
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
(13).  Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
(14).  Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
(15).  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
(16).  And she's fair I love.
(17).  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
(18).  This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
(19).  Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
      The lady widow of Vitruvio;
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
      Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
      Lucio and the lively Helena.
(20).  One fairer than my love?
(21).  Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
(22).  Thus then in brief:
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
(23).  Can you love the gentleman?
(24).  Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    Examine every married lineament,
    And see how one another lends content;
    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
    Find written in the margent of his eyes,
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    To beautify him only lacks a cover.
(25).  Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
(26).  You are a lover.
(27).  Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
(28).  And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
(29).  Is love a tender thing?
(30).  If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
(31).  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
(32).  If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Up to the ears.
(33).  And in this state she gallops night by night
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
(34).  Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
Nell.
(35).  Did my heart love till now?
(36).  My only love, sprung from my only hate!
(37).  Prodigious birth of love it is to me
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
(38).  Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
(39).  Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
(40).  Being held a foe, he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
(41).  Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
(42).  If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
(43).  It is my lady; O, it is my love!
(44).  O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!
(45).  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
(46).  Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
(47).  With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
(48).  I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
(49).  My life were better ended by their hate
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
(50).  By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
(51).  Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
    And I will take thy word.
(52).  At lovers' perjuries,
    They say Jove laughs.
(53).  O gentle Romeo,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
(54).  I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    My true-love passion.
(55).  Therefore pardon me,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
(56).  O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
(57).  If my heart's dear love-
  Jul.
(58).  This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
(59).  Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
(60).  For what purpose, love?
(61).  My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
(62).  Dear love, adieu!
(63).  If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
(64).  Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
(65).  How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!
(66).  I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
(67).  Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    By holy marriage.
(68).  Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    So soon forsaken?
(69).  Young men's love then lies
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
(70).  How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
(71).  And bad'st me bury love.
(72).  She whom I love now
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
(73).  O, she knew well
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
(74).  In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
(75).  Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
had a
    better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or
so,
    but not to the purpose.
(76).  Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
(77).  For this drivelling love is like a
    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his
bauble in
    a hole.
(78).  A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
will
    speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
(79).  Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And his to me,
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
(80).  Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
(81).  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous,
    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
is
    your mother?
(82).  Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    "Where is your mother?
(83).  Hie you to church; I must another way,
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
(84).  Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    It is enough I may but call her mine.
(85).  Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
(86).  A lover may bestride the gossamer
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
(87).  They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
(88).  Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
    No better term than this: thou art a villain.
(89).  Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    To such a greeting.
(90).  I do protest I never injur'd thee,
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
(91).  Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
(92).  Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    It best agrees with night.
(93).  Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
(94).  Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
(95).  O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
    Not yet enjoy'd.
(96).  Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    Doting like me, and like me banished,
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
(97).  My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
(98).  Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
(99).  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
(100).  A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
(101).  Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
(102).  Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    Of my child's love.
(103).  Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
    And bid her (mark you me?
(104).  Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
(105).  Look, love, what envious streaks
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
(106).  Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
(107).  I will omit no opportunity
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
(108).  And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
(109).  Some grief shows much of love;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
(110).  O, how my heart abhors
    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
(111).  Proud can I never be of what I hate,
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
(112).  Day, night, late, early,
    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
    To have her match'd; and having now provided
    A gentleman of princely parentage,
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
(113).  O, he's a lovely gentleman!
(114).  Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
(115).  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
(116).  Do not deny to him that you love me.
(117).  I will confess to you that I love him.
(118).  So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
(119).  O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
    From off the battlements of yonder tower,
    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
(120).  I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
(121).  Why, love, I say!
(122).  O love!
(123).  O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
(124).  When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
(125).  What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
(126).  This is that banish'd haughty Montague
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    It is supposed the fair creature died-
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    To the dead bodies.
(127).  By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
(128).  O my love!
(129).  Here's to my love!
(130).  It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    One that you love.
(131).  A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
(132).  This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
(133).  Capulet, Montague,
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
(1).  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
(2).  The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
(3).  In love?
(4).  Of love?
(5).  Out of her favour where I am in love.
(6).  Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
(7).  Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
(8).  Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
(9).  Why then, O brawling love!
(10).  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
(11).  Why, such is love's transgression.
(12).  This love that thou hast shown
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
(13).  Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
(14).  Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
(15).  In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
(16).  And she's fair I love.
(17).  She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
(18).  This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Such as I love; and you among the store,
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
(19).  Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
      The lady widow of Vitruvio;
      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
      Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
      Lucio and the lively Helena.
(20).  One fairer than my love?
(21).  Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
(22).  Thus then in brief:
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
(23).  Can you love the gentleman?
(24).  Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    Examine every married lineament,
    And see how one another lends content;
    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
    Find written in the margent of his eyes,
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    To beautify him only lacks a cover.
(25).  Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
(26).  You are a lover.
(27).  Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
(28).  And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
(29).  Is love a tender thing?
(30).  If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
(31).  Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
(32).  If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Up to the ears.
(33).  And in this state she gallops night by night
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
(34).  Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
Nell.
(35).  Did my heart love till now?
(36).  My only love, sprung from my only hate!
(37).  Prodigious birth of love it is to me
    That I must love a loathed enemy.
(38).  Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
(39).  Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
(40).  Being held a foe, he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
(41).  Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
(42).  If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
(43).  It is my lady; O, it is my love!
(44).  O that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!
(45).  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
(46).  Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
(47).  With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
(48).  I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And but thou love me, let them find me here.

    And I will take thy word.
(52).  At lovers' perjuries,

(53).  O gentle Romeo,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
(54).  I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    My true-love passion.
(55).  Therefore pardon me,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
(56).  O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
(57).  If my heart's dear love-
  Jul.
(58).  This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
(59).  Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
(60).  For what purpose, love?
(61).  My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    The more I have, for both are infinite.
(62).  Dear love, adieu!
(63).  If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
(64).  Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
(65).  How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!
(66).  I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
(67).  Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
    By holy marriage.
(68).  Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
    So soon forsaken?
(69).  Young men's love then lies
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
(70).  How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
(71).  And bad'st me bury love.
(72).  She whom I love now
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
(73).  O, she knew well
    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
(74).  In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    For this alliance may so happy prove
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
(75).  Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
had a
    better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or
so,
    but not to the purpose.
(76).  Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
(77).  For this drivelling love is like a
    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his
bauble in
    a hole.
(78).  A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
will
    speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
(79).  Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And his to me,
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
(80).  Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
(81).  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous,
    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
is
    your mother?
(82).  Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    "Where is your mother?
(83).  Hie you to church; I must another way,
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
(84).  Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
    It is enough I may but call her mine.
(85).  Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
(86).  A lover may bestride the gossamer
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
(87).  They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
(88).  Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
    No better term than this: thou art a villain.
(89).  Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    To such a greeting.
(90).  I do protest I never injur'd thee,
    But love thee better than thou canst devise
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
(91).  Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
(92).  Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    It best agrees with night.
(93).  Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
(94).  Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
(95).  O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
    Not yet enjoy'd.
(96).  Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    Doting like me, and like me banished,
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
(97).  My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
(98).  Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
(99).  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
    Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
(100).  A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    But, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
(101).  Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
(102).  Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    Of my child's love.
(103).  Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
    And bid her (mark you me?
(104).  Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
(105).  Look, love, what envious streaks
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
(106).  Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
(107).  I will omit no opportunity
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
(108).  And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
(109).  Some grief shows much of love;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
(110).  O, how my heart abhors
    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
(111).  Proud can I never be of what I hate,
    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
(112).  Day, night, late, early,
    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
    To have her match'd; and having now provided
    A gentleman of princely parentage,
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
(113).  O, he's a lovely gentleman!
(114).  Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
(115).  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
(116).  Do not deny to him that you love me.
(117).  I will confess to you that I love him.
(118).  So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
(119).  O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
    From off the battlements of yonder tower,
    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
(120).  I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
(121).  Why, love, I say!
(122).  O love!
(123).  O, in this love, you love your child so ill
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
(124).  When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
(125).  What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
(126).  This is that banish'd haughty Montague
    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
    It is supposed the fair creature died-
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    To the dead bodies.
(127).  By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
(128).  O my love!
(129).  Here's to my love!
(130).  It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    One that you love.
(131).  A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
(132).  This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
(133).  Capulet, Montague,
    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
