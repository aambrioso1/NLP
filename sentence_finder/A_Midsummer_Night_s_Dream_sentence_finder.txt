ACT I

SCENE I.
(1).  LYSANDER, in love with Hermia.
(2).  DEMETRIUS, in love with Hermia.
(3).  HERMIA, daughter to Egeus, in love with Lysander.
(4).  HELENA, in love with Demetrius.
(5).  Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
(6).  Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchang'd love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats,--messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;--
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
Turned her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness.
(7).  THESEUS
Take time to pause; and by the next new moon,--
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fellowship,--
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will;
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.
(8).  LYSANDER
You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
(9).  And what is mine my love shall render him;
And she is mine; and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.
(10).  LYSANDER
I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius's;
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
(11).  Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
(12).  Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
(13).  LYSANDER
How now, my love!
(14).  I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth:
But either it was different in blood,--

HERMIA
O cross!
(15).  HERMIA
If then true lovers have ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross;
As due to love as thoughts, and dreams, and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
(16).  If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.
(17).  I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow, with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Trojan under sail was seen,--
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,--
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
(18).  LYSANDER
Keep promise, love.
(19).  Demetrius loves your fair.
(20).  HERMIA
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
(21).  HERMIA
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
(22).  HELENA
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
(23).  Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto hell!
(24).  LYSANDER
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,--
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,--
Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
(25).  Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
From lovers' food, till morrow deep midnight.
(26).  Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.
(27).  QUINCE
A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.
(28).  This is
Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein;--a lover is more condoling.
(29).  QUINCE
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
(30).  Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear!
(31).  QUINCE
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's
day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must
needs play Pyramus.
(32).  For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she, as her attendant, hath
A lovely boy, stol'n from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling:
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild:
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But they do square; that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.
(33).  TITANIA
Then I must be thy lady; but I know
When thou hast stol'n away from fairy-land,
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
To amorous Phillida.
(34).  Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest steep of India,
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
To Theseus must be wedded; and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity.
(35).  OBERON
How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
(36).  OBERON
That very time I saw,--but thou couldst not,--
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Cupid, all arm'd: a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal, throned by the west;
And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon;
And the imperial votaress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
(37).  Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,--
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,--
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
(38).  OBERON
                  Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
The next thing then she waking looks upon,--
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,--
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
(39).  DEMETRIUS
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
(40).  Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?
(41).  HELENA
And even for that do I love you the more.
(42).  What worser place can I beg in your love,
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Than to be used as you use your dog?
(43).  DEMETRIUS
You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city, and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night,
And the ill counsel of a desert place,
With the rich worth of your virginity.
(44).  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love as men may do:
We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.
(45).  I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.
(46).  OBERON
Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
(47).  Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
(48).  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
(49).  Philomel, with melody,
   Sing in our sweet lullaby:
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby:
   Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,
   Come our lovely lady nigh;
   So good-night, with lullaby.
(50).  Do it for thy true-love take;
Love and languish for his sake;
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wak'st, it is thy dear;
Wake when some vile thing is near.
(51).  LYSANDER
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
  And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way;
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
  And tarry for the comfort of the day.
(52).  LYSANDER
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence;
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
(53).  But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid:
So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
(54).  PUCK
  Through the forest have I gone,
  But Athenian found I none,
  On whose eyes I might approve
  This flower's force in stirring love.
(55).  Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
(56).  Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
  All the power this charm doth owe;
  When thou wak'st let love forbid
  Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
  So awake when I am gone;
  For I must now to Oberon.
(57).  HELENA
Do not say so, Lysander; say not so:
What though he love your Hermia?
(58).  Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
(59).  Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
(60).  Things growing are not ripe until their season;
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will,
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
Love's stories, written in love's richest book.
(61).  And, all my powers, address your love and might
To honour Helen, and to be her knight!
(62).  Speak, of all loves!
(63).  THISBE
  'Most radiant Pyramus, most lily white of hue,
  Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
  As true as truest horse, that would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
(64).  So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,
On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.
(65).  BOTTOM
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for
that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little
company together now-a-days: the more the pity that some honest
neighbours will not make them friends.
(66).  I am a spirit of no common rate,--
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me,
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee;
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep:
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
(67).  TITANIA
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
The honey bags steal from the humble-bees,
And, for night-tapers, crop their waxen thighs,
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
(68).  Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
(69).  PUCK
My mistress with a monster is in love.
(70).  But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
(71).  DEMETRIUS
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
(72).  And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
(73).  OBERON
About the wood go, swifter than the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find:
All fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.
(74).  When his love he doth espy,
  Let her shine as gloriously
  As the Venus of the sky.
(75).  PUCK
  Captain of our fairy band,
  Helena is here at hand,
  And the youth mistook by me
  Pleading for a lover's fee;
  Shall we their fond pageant see?
(76).  LYSANDER
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
(77).  To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
(78).  You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision!
(79).  LYSANDER
You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
For you love Hermia: this you know I know:
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
Whom I do love and will do till my death.
(80).  DEMETRIUS
Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
(81).  Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
(82).  LYSANDER
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
(83).  HERMIA
What love could press Lysander from my side?
(84).  LYSANDER
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,--
Fair Helena,--who more engilds the night
Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
(85).  So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted;
But yet a union in partition,
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem:
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.
(86).  And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
(87).  And made your other love, Demetrius,--
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,--
To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
Precious, celestial?
(88).  Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
(89).  What though I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate;
But miserable most, to love unlov'd?
(90).  LYSANDER
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
(91).  Helen, I love thee; by my life I do;
I swear by that which I will lose for thee
To prove him false that says I love thee not.
(92).  DEMETRIUS
I say I love thee more than he can do.
(93).  Sweet love?
(94).  LYSANDER
            Thy love!
(95).  Therefore be out of hope, of question, doubt,
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.
(96).  You thief of love!
(97).  And stol'n my love's heart from him?
(98).  I evermore did love you, Hermia;
Did ever keep your counsels; never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood:
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence, and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back,
And follow you no farther.
(99).  Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.
(100).  OBERON
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight;
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog, as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another's way.
(101).  When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
With league whose date till death shall never end.
(102).  OBERON
But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport;
And, like a forester, the groves may tread
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.
(103).  PUCK
  On the ground
  Sleep sound:
  I'll apply
  To your eye,
  Gentle lover, remedy.
(104).  TITANIA
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
(105).  TITANIA
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
(106).  O, how I love thee!
(107).  OBERON
There lies your love.
(108).  Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
And bless it to all fair prosperity:
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
(109).  THESEUS
Go, one of you, find out the forester;--
For now our observation is perform'd;
And since we have the vaward of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds,--
Uncouple in the western valley; go:--
Despatch, I say, and find the forester.
(110).  But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow--seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gawd
Which in my childhood I did dote upon:
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena.
(111).  To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.
(112).  THESEUS
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
(113).  HIPPOLYTA
'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
(114).  The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
That is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
(115).  THESEUS
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
(116).  We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
(117).  A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
  And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.
(118).  HIPPOLYTA
I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
And duty in his service perishing.
(119).  This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
  Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
  To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.
(120).  This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
  Presenteth Moonshine: for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
  To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
(121).  For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
At large discourse while here they do remain.
(122).  WALL
In this same interlude it doth befall
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall:
And such a wall as I would have you think
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
(123).  This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
(124).  And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
 That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
  Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.
(125).  THISBE
        My love!
(126).  PYRAMUS
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
And like Limander am I trusty still.
(127).  Where is my love?
(128).  HIPPOLYTA
How chance moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
back and finds her lover?
(129).  THISBE
     Asleep, my love?
(1).  LYSANDER, in love with Hermia.
(2).  DEMETRIUS, in love with Hermia.
(3).  HERMIA, daughter to Egeus, in love with Lysander.
(4).  HELENA, in love with Demetrius.
(5).  Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
(6).  Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchang'd love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats,--messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;--
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
Turned her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness.
(7).  THESEUS
Take time to pause; and by the next new moon,--
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fellowship,--
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will;
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.
(8).  LYSANDER
You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
(9).  And what is mine my love shall render him;
And she is mine; and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.
(10).  LYSANDER
I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius's;
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
(11).  Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
(12).  Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
(13).  LYSANDER
How now, my love!
(14).  I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth:
But either it was different in blood,--

HERMIA
O cross!
(15).  HERMIA
If then true lovers have ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross;
As due to love as thoughts, and dreams, and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
(16).  If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.
(17).  I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow, with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Trojan under sail was seen,--
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,--
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
(18).  LYSANDER
Keep promise, love.
(19).  Demetrius loves your fair.
(20).  HERMIA
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
(21).  HERMIA
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
(22).  HELENA
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
(23).  Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto hell!
(24).  LYSANDER
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,--
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,--
Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
(25).  Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
From lovers' food, till morrow deep midnight.
(26).  Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.
(27).  QUINCE
A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.
(28).  This is
Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein;--a lover is more condoling.
(29).  QUINCE
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
(30).  Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear!
(31).  QUINCE
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's
day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must
needs play Pyramus.
(32).  For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she, as her attendant, hath
A lovely boy, stol'n from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling:
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild:
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But they do square; that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.
(33).  TITANIA
Then I must be thy lady; but I know
When thou hast stol'n away from fairy-land,
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
To amorous Phillida.
(34).  Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest steep of India,
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
To Theseus must be wedded; and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity.
(35).  OBERON
How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
(36).  OBERON
That very time I saw,--but thou couldst not,--
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Cupid, all arm'd: a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal, throned by the west;
And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon;
And the imperial votaress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
(37).  Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,--
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,--
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
(38).  OBERON
                  Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
The next thing then she waking looks upon,--
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,--
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
(39).  DEMETRIUS
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
(40).  Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?
(41).  HELENA
And even for that do I love you the more.
(42).  What worser place can I beg in your love,
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Than to be used as you use your dog?
(43).  DEMETRIUS
You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city, and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night,
And the ill counsel of a desert place,
With the rich worth of your virginity.
(44).  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love as men may do:
We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.
(45).  I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.
(46).  OBERON
Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
(47).  Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
(48).  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
(49).  Philomel, with melody,
   Sing in our sweet lullaby:
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby:
   Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,
   Come our lovely lady nigh;
   So good-night, with lullaby.
(50).  Do it for thy true-love take;
Love and languish for his sake;
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wak'st, it is thy dear;
Wake when some vile thing is near.
(51).  LYSANDER
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
  And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way;
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
  And tarry for the comfort of the day.
(52).  LYSANDER
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence;
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
(53).  But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid:
So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
(54).  PUCK
  Through the forest have I gone,
  But Athenian found I none,
  On whose eyes I might approve
  This flower's force in stirring love.
(55).  Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
(56).  Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
  All the power this charm doth owe;
  When thou wak'st let love forbid
  Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
  So awake when I am gone;
  For I must now to Oberon.
(57).  HELENA
Do not say so, Lysander; say not so:
What though he love your Hermia?
(58).  Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
(59).  Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
(60).  Things growing are not ripe until their season;
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will,
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
Love's stories, written in love's richest book.
(61).  And, all my powers, address your love and might
To honour Helen, and to be her knight!
(62).  Speak, of all loves!
(63).  THISBE
  'Most radiant Pyramus, most lily white of hue,
  Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
  As true as truest horse, that would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
(64).  So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,
On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.
(65).  BOTTOM
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for
that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little
company together now-a-days: the more the pity that some honest
neighbours will not make them friends.
(66).  I am a spirit of no common rate,--
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me,
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee;
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep:
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
(67).  TITANIA
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
The honey bags steal from the humble-bees,
And, for night-tapers, crop their waxen thighs,
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
(68).  Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
(69).  PUCK
My mistress with a monster is in love.
(70).  But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
(71).  DEMETRIUS
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
(72).  And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
(73).  OBERON
About the wood go, swifter than the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find:
All fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.
(74).  When his love he doth espy,
  Let her shine as gloriously
  As the Venus of the sky.
(75).  PUCK
  Captain of our fairy band,
  Helena is here at hand,
  And the youth mistook by me
  Pleading for a lover's fee;
  Shall we their fond pageant see?
(76).  LYSANDER
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
(77).  To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
(78).  You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision!
(79).  LYSANDER
You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
For you love Hermia: this you know I know:
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
Whom I do love and will do till my death.
(80).  DEMETRIUS
Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
(81).  Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
(82).  LYSANDER
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
(83).  HERMIA
What love could press Lysander from my side?
(84).  LYSANDER
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,--
Fair Helena,--who more engilds the night
Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
(85).  So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted;
But yet a union in partition,
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem:
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.
(86).  And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
(87).  And made your other love, Demetrius,--
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,--
To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
Precious, celestial?
(88).  Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
(89).  What though I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate;
But miserable most, to love unlov'd?
(90).  LYSANDER
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
(91).  Helen, I love thee; by my life I do;
I swear by that which I will lose for thee
To prove him false that says I love thee not.
(92).  DEMETRIUS
I say I love thee more than he can do.
(93).  Sweet love?
(94).  LYSANDER
            Thy love!
(95).  Therefore be out of hope, of question, doubt,
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.
(96).  You thief of love!
(97).  And stol'n my love's heart from him?
(98).  I evermore did love you, Hermia;
Did ever keep your counsels; never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood:
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence, and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back,
And follow you no farther.
(99).  Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.
(100).  OBERON
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight;
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog, as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another's way.
(101).  When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
With league whose date till death shall never end.
(102).  OBERON
But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport;
And, like a forester, the groves may tread
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.
(103).  PUCK
  On the ground
  Sleep sound:
  I'll apply
  To your eye,
  Gentle lover, remedy.
(104).  TITANIA
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
(105).  TITANIA
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
(106).  O, how I love thee!
(107).  OBERON
There lies your love.
(108).  Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
And bless it to all fair prosperity:
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
(109).  THESEUS
Go, one of you, find out the forester;--
For now our observation is perform'd;
And since we have the vaward of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds,--
Uncouple in the western valley; go:--
Despatch, I say, and find the forester.
(110).  But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow--seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gawd
Which in my childhood I did dote upon:
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena.
(111).  To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.
(112).  THESEUS
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
(113).  HIPPOLYTA
'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
(114).  The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
That is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
(115).  THESEUS
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
(116).  We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
(117).  A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
  And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.
(118).  HIPPOLYTA
I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
And duty in his service perishing.
(119).  This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
  Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
  To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.
(120).  This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
  Presenteth Moonshine: for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
  To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
(121).  For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
At large discourse while here they do remain.
(122).  WALL
In this same interlude it doth befall
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall:
And such a wall as I would have you think
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
(123).  This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
(124).  And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
 That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
  Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.
(125).  THISBE
        My love!
(126).  PYRAMUS
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
And like Limander am I trusty still.
(127).  Where is my love?
(128).  HIPPOLYTA
How chance moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
back and finds her lover?
(129).  THISBE
     Asleep, my love?
(1).  LYSANDER, in love with Hermia.
(2).  DEMETRIUS, in love with Hermia.
(3).  HERMIA, daughter to Egeus, in love with Lysander.
(4).  HELENA, in love with Demetrius.
(5).  Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.
(6).  Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchang'd love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats,--messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;--
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
Turned her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness.
(7).  THESEUS
Take time to pause; and by the next new moon,--
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fellowship,--
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will;
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.
(8).  LYSANDER
You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
(9).  And what is mine my love shall render him;
And she is mine; and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.
(10).  LYSANDER
I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius's;
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
(11).  Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
(12).  Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
(13).  LYSANDER
How now, my love!
(14).  I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth:
But either it was different in blood,--

HERMIA
O cross!
(15).  HERMIA
If then true lovers have ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross;
As due to love as thoughts, and dreams, and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
(16).  If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.
(17).  I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow, with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Trojan under sail was seen,--
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,--
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
(18).  LYSANDER
Keep promise, love.
(19).  Demetrius loves your fair.
(20).  HERMIA
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
(21).  HERMIA
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
(22).  HELENA
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
(23).  Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto hell!
(24).  LYSANDER
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,--
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,--
Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
(25).  Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
From lovers' food, till morrow deep midnight.
(26).  Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.
(27).  QUINCE
A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.
(28).  This is
Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein;--a lover is more condoling.
(29).  QUINCE
It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
(30).  Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear!
(31).  QUINCE
You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's
day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must
needs play Pyramus.
(32).  For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she, as her attendant, hath
A lovely boy, stol'n from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling:
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild:
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But they do square; that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.
(33).  TITANIA
Then I must be thy lady; but I know
When thou hast stol'n away from fairy-land,
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love
To amorous Phillida.
(34).  Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest steep of India,
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
To Theseus must be wedded; and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity.
(35).  OBERON
How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
(36).  OBERON
That very time I saw,--but thou couldst not,--
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Cupid, all arm'd: a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal, throned by the west;
And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon;
And the imperial votaress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
(37).  Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,--
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,--
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
(38).  OBERON
                  Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
The next thing then she waking looks upon,--
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,--
She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
(39).  DEMETRIUS
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
(40).  Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?
(41).  HELENA
And even for that do I love you the more.
(42).  What worser place can I beg in your love,
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Than to be used as you use your dog?
(43).  DEMETRIUS
You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city, and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night,
And the ill counsel of a desert place,
With the rich worth of your virginity.
(44).  Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love as men may do:
We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.
(45).  I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.
(46).  OBERON
Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
(47).  Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
(48).  Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
(49).  Philomel, with melody,
   Sing in our sweet lullaby:
Lulla, lulla, lullaby; lulla, lulla, lullaby:
   Never harm, nor spell, nor charm,
   Come our lovely lady nigh;
   So good-night, with lullaby.
(50).  Do it for thy true-love take;
Love and languish for his sake;
Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
In thy eye that shall appear
When thou wak'st, it is thy dear;
Wake when some vile thing is near.
(51).  LYSANDER
Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
  And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way;
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
  And tarry for the comfort of the day.
(52).  LYSANDER
O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence;
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
(53).  But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid:
So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
(54).  PUCK
  Through the forest have I gone,
  But Athenian found I none,
  On whose eyes I might approve
  This flower's force in stirring love.
(55).  Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
(56).  Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
  All the power this charm doth owe;
  When thou wak'st let love forbid
  Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
  So awake when I am gone;
  For I must now to Oberon.
(57).  HELENA
Do not say so, Lysander; say not so:
What though he love your Hermia?
(58).  Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
(59).  Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
(60).  Things growing are not ripe until their season;
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will,
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
Love's stories, written in love's richest book.
(61).  And, all my powers, address your love and might
To honour Helen, and to be her knight!
(62).  Speak, of all loves!
(63).  THISBE
  'Most radiant Pyramus, most lily white of hue,
  Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
  As true as truest horse, that would never tire,
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
(64).  So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,
On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee.
(65).  BOTTOM
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for
that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little
company together now-a-days: the more the pity that some honest
neighbours will not make them friends.
(66).  I am a spirit of no common rate,--
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me,
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee;
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep:
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
(67).  TITANIA
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
The honey bags steal from the humble-bees,
And, for night-tapers, crop their waxen thighs,
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
(68).  Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
(69).  PUCK
My mistress with a monster is in love.
(70).  But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
(71).  DEMETRIUS
O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
(72).  And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.
(73).  OBERON
About the wood go, swifter than the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find:
All fancy-sick she is, and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.
(74).  When his love he doth espy,
  Let her shine as gloriously
  As the Venus of the sky.
(75).  PUCK
  Captain of our fairy band,
  Helena is here at hand,
  And the youth mistook by me
  Pleading for a lover's fee;
  Shall we their fond pageant see?
(76).  LYSANDER
Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
(77).  To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
(78).  You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision!
(79).  LYSANDER
You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
For you love Hermia: this you know I know:
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
Whom I do love and will do till my death.
(80).  DEMETRIUS
Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
If e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.
(81).  Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
(82).  LYSANDER
Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
(83).  HERMIA
What love could press Lysander from my side?
(84).  LYSANDER
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,--
Fair Helena,--who more engilds the night
Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
(85).  So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted;
But yet a union in partition,
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem:
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.
(86).  And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
(87).  And made your other love, Demetrius,--
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,--
To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,
Precious, celestial?
(88).  Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
(89).  What though I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate;
But miserable most, to love unlov'd?
(90).  LYSANDER
Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!
(91).  Helen, I love thee; by my life I do;
I swear by that which I will lose for thee
To prove him false that says I love thee not.
(92).  DEMETRIUS
I say I love thee more than he can do.
(93).  Sweet love?
(94).  LYSANDER
            Thy love!
(95).  Therefore be out of hope, of question, doubt,
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.
(96).  You thief of love!
(97).  And stol'n my love's heart from him?
(98).  I evermore did love you, Hermia;
Did ever keep your counsels; never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood:
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence, and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back,
And follow you no farther.
(99).  Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.
(100).  OBERON
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight;
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog, as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another's way.
(101).  When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
With league whose date till death shall never end.
(102).  OBERON
But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport;
And, like a forester, the groves may tread
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.
(103).  PUCK
  On the ground
  Sleep sound:
  I'll apply
  To your eye,
  Gentle lover, remedy.
(104).  TITANIA
What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
(105).  TITANIA
Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
(106).  O, how I love thee!
(107).  OBERON
There lies your love.
(108).  Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
And bless it to all fair prosperity:
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
(109).  THESEUS
Go, one of you, find out the forester;--
For now our observation is perform'd;
And since we have the vaward of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds,--
Uncouple in the western valley; go:--
Despatch, I say, and find the forester.
(110).  But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow--seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gawd
Which in my childhood I did dote upon:
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena.
(111).  To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.
(112).  THESEUS
Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
(113).  HIPPOLYTA
'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
(114).  The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
That is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
(115).  THESEUS
Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
(116).  We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
(117).  A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
  And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.
(118).  HIPPOLYTA
I love not to see wretchedness o'er-charged,
And duty in his service perishing.
(119).  This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
  Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
  To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.
(120).  This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
  Presenteth Moonshine: for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
  To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
(121).  For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,
At large discourse while here they do remain.
(122).  WALL
In this same interlude it doth befall
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall:
And such a wall as I would have you think
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
(123).  This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
(124).  And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
 That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
  Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.
(125).  THISBE
        My love!
(126).  PYRAMUS
Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
And like Limander am I trusty still.
(127).  Where is my love?
(128).  HIPPOLYTA
How chance moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
back and finds her lover?
(129).  THISBE
     Asleep, my love?
