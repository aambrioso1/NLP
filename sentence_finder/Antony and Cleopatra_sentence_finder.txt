(1).  If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
(2).  There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
(3).  How, my love!
(4).  Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
(5).  Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now:--what sport to-night?
(6).  You shall be more beloving than beloved.
(7).  I love long life better than figs.
(8).  Alack, sir, no: her passions are made of nothing but the finest
part of pure love: we cannot call her winds and waters, sighs and
tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can
report: this cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
shower of rain as well as Jove.
(9).  For not alone
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
The empire of the sea; our slippery people,--
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
Till his deserts are past,--begin to throw
Pompey the Great, and all his dignities,
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life
And not a serpent's poison.
(10).  Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him.
(11).  Our Italy
Shines o'er with civil swords:  Sextus Pompeius
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
Equality of two domestic powers
Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,
Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace
Into the hearts of such as have not thriv'd
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
By any desperate change.
(12).  O most false love!
(13).  Cut my lace, Charmian, come;--
But let it be: I am quickly ill and well,
So Antony loves.
(14).  My precious queen, forbear;
And give true evidence to his love, which stands
An honourable trial.
(15).  I should have known no less:
It hath been taught us from the primal state
That he which is was wish'd until he were;
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
Comes dear'd by being lack'd.
(16).  Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Caesar so?
(17).  I shall do well;
The people love me, and the sea is mine;
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
Says it will come to the full.
(18).  Mark Antony
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves
Nor either cares for him.
(19).  But all the charms of love,
Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan'd lip!
(20).  Or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may,
when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again: you shall
have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
(21).  By this marriage
All little jealousies, which now seem great,
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
Would each to other, and all loves to both,
Draw after her.
(22).  Let me have thy hand:
Further this act of grace; and from this hour
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
And sway our great designs!
(23).  A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
Did ever love so dearly: let her live
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
Fly off our loves again!
(24).  The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes.
(25).  Give me some music,--music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.
(26).  I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than
the love of the parties.
(27).  A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
(28).  But he loves Caesar best;--yet he loves Antony:
Hoo!
(29).  His love to Antony.
(30).  Both he loves.
(31).  Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have lov'd without this mean if on both parts
This be not cherish'd.
(32).  The April's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
And these the showers to bring it on.
(33).  Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.
(34).  Gentle Octavia,
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
I lose myself: better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless.
(35).  When it appears to you where this begins,
Turn your displeasure that way; for our faults
Can never be so equal that your love
Can equally move with them.
(36).  You come not
Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher, and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
Rais'd by your populous troops: but you are come
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
The ostentation of our love, which left unshown
Is often left unlov'd; we should have met you
By sea and land; supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.
(37).  You are abus'd
Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
To do you justice, make their ministers
Of us and those that love you.
(38).  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
Only theadulterous Antony, most large
In his abominations, turns you off,
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
That noises it against us.
(39).  He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
(40).  The next time I do fight
I'll make death love me; for I will contend
Even with his pestilent scythe.
(41).  O love,
That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
The royal occupation!
(42).  Good-morrow to thee; welcome:
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
To business that we love we rise betime,
And go to't with delight.
(43).  Why is my lord enrag'd against his love?
(44).  My queen and Eros
Have, by their brave instruction, got upon me
A nobleness in record: but I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
As to a lover's bed.
(45).  Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
(46).  The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
Than love that's hir'd!
(47).  Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
Which my love makes religion to obey,
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
Intends his journey; and within three days
You with your children will he send before:
Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
Your pleasure and my promise.
(48).  If thus thou and nature can so gently part,
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
Which hurts and is desir'd.
(1).  If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
(2).  There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
(3).  How, my love!
(4).  Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
(5).  Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now:--what sport to-night?
(6).  You shall be more beloving than beloved.
