(1).  Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
(2).  We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you.
(3).  For God's love let me hear!
(4).  I will requite your loves.
(5).  Your loves, as mine to you.
(6).  Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth.
(7).  Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
(8).  My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
    In honourable fashion.
(9).  If thou didst ever thy dear father love-
  Ham.
(10).  Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
(11).  O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there,
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
(12).  So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you;
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do t' express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack.
(13).  Mad for thy love?
(14).  This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures.
(15).  This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
(16).  Doubt thou the stars are fire;
            Doubt that the sun doth move;
          Doubt truth to be a liar;
            But never doubt I love.
(17).  O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art
to
    reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best,
believe
    it.
(18).  But how hath she
    Receiv'd his love?
(19).  But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing
    (As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me), what might you,
    Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight?
(20).  If he love her not,
    And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.
(21).  And truly in my youth I suff'red much
extremity
    for love- very near this.
(22).  But let me conjure you by the
rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear
a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct
with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.
(23).  If you love me,
hold
    not off.
(24).  He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
    have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil
and
    target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man
shall
    end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't.
(25).  Why,

         'One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loved passing well.
(26).  If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
    love passing well.
(27).  Her father and myself (lawful espials)
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge
    And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
    If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
(28).  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin?
(29).  I did love you once.
(30).  I loved
you
    not.
(31).  But yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love.
(32).  The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his love.
(33).  As woman's love.
(34).  Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
      Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
      And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world have times twelve thirties been,
      Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      Unite comutual in most sacred bands.
(35).  So many journeys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
(36).  Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must;
      For women's fear and love holds quantity,
      In neither aught, or in extremity.
(37).  Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
      And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
(38).  Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
      Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
(39).  Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
      My operant powers their functions leave to do.
(40).  Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
(41).  The instances that second marriage move
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
(42).  This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
      That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
      For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
      Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
(43).  The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
      The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
      And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
(44).  I could interpret between you and your love, if I could
see
    the puppets dallying.
(45).  You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's
wife.
(46).  My lord, you once did love me.
(47).  O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
(48).  Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
    Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
    And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
    As false as dicers' oaths.
(49).  You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
    Would step from this to this?
(50).  Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty!
(51).  Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
(52).  But so much was our love
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of life.
(53).  Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us,- thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet.
(54).  How should I your true-love know
           From another one?
(55).  Sings)
           Larded all with sweet flowers;
         Which bewept to the grave did not go
           With true-love showers.
(56).  Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.
(57).  Pray you, love,
    remember.
(58).  The other motive
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great love the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gives to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.
(59).  I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.
(60).  Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
(61).  There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too-much.
(62).  In youth when I did love, did love,
         Methought it was very sweet;
       To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
         O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
(63).  Forty thousand brothers
    Could not (with all their quantity of love)
    Make up my sum.
(64).  For love of God, forbear him!
(65).  An earnest conjuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like as's of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving time allow'd.
(66).  Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
(67).  But till that time
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.
(1).  Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
(2).  We pray you throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father; for let the world take note
