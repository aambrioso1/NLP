(1).  But I,--that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;--
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun,
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore,--since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,--
I am determined to prove a villain,
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
(2).  I do love thee so
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
(3).  The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I; not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent,
By marrying her, which I must reach unto.
(4).  It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
(5).  He lives that loves thee better than he could.
(6).  That was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and even with the word,
This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love;
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
(7).  A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,--
Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,--
The spacious world cannot again afford:
And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woeful bed?
(8).  But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
(9).  Ah, he is young; and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloster,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
(10).  Yet, Stanley, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
(11).  They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:--
Who are they that complain unto the king
That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
(12).  By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
(13).  Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
(14).  My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
(15).  Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy faults,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
(16).  If you do love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
(17).  O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me.
(18).  Tell him when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloster think of this, and he will weep.
(19).  Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
(20).  By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
(21).  So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
(22).  And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
(23).  Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
(24).  Dorset, embrace him;--Hastings, love lord marquis.
(25).  This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be inviolable.
(26).  Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
Upon your grace [to the queen], but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love!
(27).  I beg of heaven
When I am cold in love to you or yours.
(28).  Gloster, we have done deeds of charity;
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
(29).  A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord,--
Among this princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe;
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
To any in this presence, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
(30).  Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,
To be so flouted in this royal presence?
(31).  Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloster
Told me, the king, provok'd to it by the queen,
Devis'd impeachments to imprison him:
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly as his child.
(32).  You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's love:
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
(33).  He for his father's sake so loves the prince
That he will not be won to aught against him.
(34).  Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
(35).  I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
But for his purpose in the coronation
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
(36).  Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
(37).  I think there's ne'er a man in Christendom
Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
(38).  The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
Makes me most forward in this princely presence
To doom the offenders: whosoe'er they be.
(39).  Lovel and Ratcliff:--look that it be done:--
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
(40).  I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,--
As being got, your father then in France,
And his resemblance, being not like the duke:
Withal I did infer your lineaments,--
Being the right idea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse:
And when mine oratory drew toward end
I bid them that did love their country's good
Cry "God save Richard, England's royal king!
(41).  And thus I took the vantage of those few,--
"Thanks, gentle citizens and friends," quoth I;
"This general applause and cheerful shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:"
And even here brake off and came away.
(42).  Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
And so once more return and tell his grace.
(43).  I cannot tell if to depart in silence
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
Best fitteth my degree or your condition:
If not to answer, you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
So season'd with your faithful love to me,
Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
(44).  Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
(45).  Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
(46).  If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
Loath to depose the child, your brother's son--
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have noted in you to your kindred,
And equally, indeed, to all estates,--
Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
But we will plant some other in the throne,
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
And in this resolution here we leave you.
(47).  Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love, to greet the tender princes.
(48).  Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
(49).  Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,
And take thy office from thee on my peril.
(50).  There is no more but so:--say it is done,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee for it.
(51).  Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
(52).  That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
(53).  Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter,
And do intend to make her Queen of England.
(54).  If this inducement move her not to love,
Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;
Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake
Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
(55).  Say that I did all this for love of her?
(56).  Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
(57).  A grandam's name is little less in love
Than is the doating title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
Of all one pain,--save for a night of groans
Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
(58).  Under what title shall I woo for thee,
That God, the law, my honour, and her love
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
(59).  Say I will love her everlastingly.
(60).  Therefore, dear mother,--I must call you so,--
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
And be not peevish found in great designs.
(61).  Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
(62).  Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
Which so-long-sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
(63).  Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
(64).  Alack, I love myself.
(65).  There is no creature loves me;
And if I die no soul will pity me:
And wherefore should they,--since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself?
(1).  But I,--that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;--
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,

And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore,--since I cannot prove a lover,

I am determined to prove a villain,
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.

If heaven will take the present at our hands.

Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I; not all so much for love

By marrying her, which I must reach unto.
(4).  It is a quarrel most unnatural,
